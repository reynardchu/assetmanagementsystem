<h3>Background</h3>
<p>
Web NFC aims to provide sites the ability to read and write to NFC tags when
they are brought in close proximity to the userâ€™s device (usually 5-10 cm, 2-4
inches). The current scope is limited to NDEF, a lightweight binary message
format. Low-level I/O operations (e.g. ISO-DEP, NFC-A/B, NFC-F) and Host-based
Card Emulation (HCE) are not supported within the current scope.
